# Real-time fluid simulation
This project is a real-time fluid simulation implemented using Compute Shaders and Godot.

## References
The work is primarily based on:
- https://data.exppad.com/public/papers/Fast%20Hydraulic%20Erosion%20Simulation%20and%20Visualization%20on%20GPU.pdf
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06087.pdf

## Usage
- Load the project and enter the main scene
- Select the Fluidsim object
- Switch to 3D and pan to the desired view. The texture has some post processing for multiple colors and height, the sprite is the raw data
- Check "Run in Editor" on the Fluidsim object

You should now see a cube of water slowly spread out.
